"""In the year 2086, the eccentric trillionaire Octavian Heximus founded the Martian Olympics. Below are a series of
events that he included. Your job is to write programs to help players strategize the best moves to make in the
different games.

In the betting game "Discordian Poker", the level of each playerâ€™s bet changes every round until one player wins.

If your current bet is odd, it goes down by $15, but the remaining amount must be doubled.
If your current bet is even, it goes down by $99, but the remaining amount must be tripled.
If your bet would pass $1,000,000, it loops back around (so a bet of $1,000,007 just becomes $7). Likewise, any bet that
goes below $0 ALSO loops around (so a bet of -$7 would become a bet of $999,993).
Given a starting bet ( S ) and a specified number of rounds played ( k ), determine what your final bet will be at the
 end of the game.

Input Format The first line is a number ( T ), indicating the number of test cases. The next T lines each have two
values, S and k, indicating the starting bet and the number of rounds the game goes, respectively.
